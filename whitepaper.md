DNA Matching White Paper, v1.2
Background
Since 2006, the year 23andme was founded, the leading driver for the direct-to-consumer genetic testing market has been ancestry prediction and DNA relatives matching services. The  personal genomics companies have these services on their front page.
Despite the availability of scientific and research information on the methods for determining kinship and the accessibility of relevant tools, assembling a pipeline that stably operates on a real-world genotypic data requires significant research and development resources for companies that have decided to provide this service.
Currently, there is no end-to-end solution for relatedness detection in genomic data available, that is reliable and accurate up to 8th degree, combines the necessary processing steps to work on real data, and which is ready for production integration. 
We believe that genomic scientists, bioinformaticians and genealogists can form an open-source community for implementation of tools based on scientific knowledge. Software freedom is essential to advance efficiency, interoperability, and speed of innovation   for the benefit of society.
 
Summary
This document describes the first version of the production-ready pipeline for relatedness detection in genomic data. The pipeline combines essential data processing steps to work with read data, and is well-accurate for up to 8th-degree relatives (e.g., third cousins).
The document includes an overview of the tools and methods used, as well as assessing accuracy test results.
The pipeline is a free and open-source project under GPLv3 license.
